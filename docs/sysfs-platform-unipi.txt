What:		/sys/devices/platform/unipi_plc/io_group[1-9]/do_[1-9]_[0-9][0-9]/pwm_duty_cycle
Date:		February 2018
Contact:	Tomas Knot <tomasknot@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file is used to set the PWM duty cycle of a digital input [0-9][1-9]
		on the undelying UniPi Neuron PLC group [1-9]. It is relative to the
		pwm_frequency_cycle	setting, i.e. for duty cycle of 50% one would use a
		value which is exactly half of the pwm_frequency_cycle setting. This file
		can be both read and written to; and -unlike the frequency options- is
		unique for each output within the group.

		The maximum allowable value is 65535, i.e. the limit of the underlying 16-bit
		unsigned register.
		
What:		/sys/devices/platform/unipi_plc/io_group[1-9]/do_[1-9]_[0-9][0-9]/pwm_frequency_cycle
Date:		February 2018
Contact:	Tomas Knot <tomasknot@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file is used to set the PWM cycle frequency for the _entire_ group
		[1-9] on the undelying UniPi Neuron PLC. It is used in conjunction with the
		pwm_prescale setting, with the product of these two values used as a 
		divider for the PWM clock. The PWM clock runs on 48Mhz by default; therefore
		the allowable PWM frequencies range from 24Mhz to ~0.0111Hz. One should note
		that at the high end of this range the PWM square wave will be quite irregular,
		due to the time the underlying transistors need to change state. This file
		can be both read and written to.

		The maximum allowable value is 65535, i.e. the limit of the underlying 16-bit
		unsigned register.

Contact:	Tomas Knot <tomasknot@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file is used to set the PWM frequency prescaler for the _entire_ group
		[1-9] on the undelying UniPi Neuron PLC. It is used in conjunction with the
		pwm_frequency_cycle setting, with the product of these two values used as a 
		divider for the PWM clock. It differs from pwm_frequency_cycle in that it has
		no effect on the maximum precision of the pwm_duty_cycle setting; for this 
		reason the pwm_frequency_cycle setting should be maximised where possible, 
		while this setting should be minimised.
		
		The PWM clock runs on 48Mhz by default; therefore the allowable PWM frequencies
		range from 24Mhz to ~0.0111Hz. One should note that at the high end of this
		range the PWM square wave will be quite irregular, due to the time the PWM

Contact:	Tomas Knot <tomasknot@gmail.com>
Description:
		This file contains the current status of one of the transistor outputs on

		output is set to a logical value of 1. 	This file can be both read and
		written into.
		
		Writing to this file will change the digital output state according to the
		rules above.
